## Welcome and About
Hi, I am a software engineer and researcher with demonstrated experience in machine learning and non-linear optimization strategies, with a strong sense for clean, modular code.

My experience helped me develop tailored software solutions in computational materials science, decision-making strategies in cells, and autonomous navigation. I am a compassionate learner and an AI and technology enthusiast.
