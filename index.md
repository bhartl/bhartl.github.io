## Hey there
My name is Ben Hartl and I am a software engineer, physicist and researcher with demonstrated experience in machine learning and non-linear optimization strategies, with a strong sense for clean, modular code.

My experience helped me develop tailored software solutions in computational materials science, [decision-making strategies in cells](https://www.pnas.org/content/118/19/e2019683118), and autonomous navigation. 
Currently I'm working on further-developing [worldmodels](https://worldmodels.github.io/) and [attention agents](https://attentionagent.github.io/) for reinforcement learning problems.

I am a compassionate learner and an AI and technology enthusiast.
