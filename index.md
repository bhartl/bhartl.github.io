## In a Nutshell
My name is Ben Hartl and I am a software engineer, physicist and researcher with demonstrated experience in machine learning and non-linear optimization strategies, with a strong sense for clean, modular code.

My experience helped me develop tailored software solutions in 
<a class="" target='blank' href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.115.033601">quantum optics</a>, 
<a class="" target='blank' href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jctc.9b01251">computational materials science</a>, and
<a class="" target='blank' href="https://www.pnas.org/content/118/19/e2019683118">decision-making strategies in cells</a>. 
Currently, I'm working on further-developing 
<a class="" target='blank' href="https://worldmodels.github.io/">worldmodels</a> and 
<a class="" target='blank' href="https://attentionagent.github.io/">attention agents</a> for reinforcement learning problems in autonomous navigation.

I am a compassionate learner and an AI and technology enthusiast.
