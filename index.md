## About Me
My name is Ben Hartl and I am a software engineer, physicist and researcher with demonstrated experience in machine learning and non-linear optimization strategies, with a strong sense for clean, modular code.

My experience helped me develop tailored software solutions in computational materials science, 
<a class="" target='blank' href="https://www.pnas.org/content/118/19/e2019683118">decision-making strategies in cells</a>, and autonomous navigation. 
Currently I'm working on further-developing 
<a class="" target='blank' href="https://worldmodels.github.io/">worldmodels</a> and 
<a class="" target='blank' href="https://attentionagent.github.io/">attention agents</a> for reinforcement learning problems.

I am a compassionate learner and an AI and technology enthusiast.
