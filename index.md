## In a Nutshell

<img style="float: right; width: 42%; padding: 10px;" src="img/portrait.png">

<p align="justify">
  My name is Ben, and I am a postdoctoral researcher in computational physics and bio-inspired artificial intelligence. My research interests span from soft- and active-matter physics and non-equilibrium thermodynamics over complex biological systems to non-linear optimization and collective multi-agent-based machine learning. 
</p>

<p align="justify">
  During my studies at the TU Wien, I worked on a variety of topics such as
  <a class="" target='blank' href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.115.033601">quantum optics</a>, 
  <a class="" target='blank' href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jctc.9b01251">computational materials science</a>, and
  <a class="" target='blank' href="https://www.pnas.org/content/118/19/e2019683118">reinforcement learning of decision-making strategies of cells</a>.
  After my PhD, my experience helped me conduct cutting-edge research with industrial partners in robust, biologically inspired autonomous navigation in maritime environments.

Currently, my research is focused on the <a class="" target='blank' href="https://doi.org/10.3390/e26070532">Evolutionary Implications of Self-Assembling Cybernetic Materials with Collective Problem-Solving Intelligence at Multiple Scales</a>. To this end, I utilize cutting-edge multi-agent-based machine learning techniques to model and train <a class="" target='blank' href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/systems-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2022.768201/full">multi-scale competency architectures that represent the foundation of biology</a>: we deploy swarms of virtual, adaptive, communicating agents that implement a minimal model for morphogenesis of multi-cellular tissue based on individual decision-making, and we investigate how evolutionary processes and connectionist approaches operate on such hierarchical agential- rather than passive materials.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Further, I investigate how ideas from developmental biology, biophysics, and tools from <a class="" target='blank' href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_life">Artificial Life</a> (specifically Neural Cellular Automata and neuroevolution) gear into each other and can be tuned into <a class="" target='blank' href="https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2407.09438">decentralized decision-making policies for robust autonomous navigation strategies for virtual, in-silico microswimmers</a>, or facilitate physiological computation in soft-matter systems.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Through this, I aim to further the understanding of learning, cognition, and (biological & artificial) intelligence as a collective, scale-free phenomenon and thus shed new light on fundamental biological processes such as computation, intelligence, and evolution <a class="" target='blank' href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjGFp7lMi9A">at the edge of order and chaos</a>.
</p>

<p align="justify">
  I am a passionate learner, a creative interdisciplinary scientific researcher, and AI, technology, and - most recently - a biology enthusiast.
