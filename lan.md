### Interfacing:
Especially during my Ph.D., I could profit from legacy code provided by my host-group (written in Fortran or C++).
Python is a great language for maintaining projects, but being an interpreted language, it is considerably less performant as compiled code, if not used appropriately.
By compiling highly-performant (legacy) code as Python modules, we can have the best of both worlds: performant code which is easy to maintain.

Libraries and Tools:
[Fortran to Python interface generator, f2py](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/f2py/),
[Boost-Python](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_63_0/libs/python/doc/html/index.html) for C++,
